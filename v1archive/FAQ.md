## How can I help?

You want to help the team in getting ready for GDPR? Great! Some places to start:
* Check the roadmap on [https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info/blob/master/Roadmap.md](https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info/blob/master/Roadmap.md)
* Look at the Trac tickets on [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&keywords=~gdpr](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&keywords=~gdpr) and see where you can help with patching or give your comments.
* Help update information on our (temporary) GitHub repository on [https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info](https://github.com/gdpr-compliance/info). Just propose your changes and somebody will evaluate and add them.
* And last but not least, let the world know! The more you tweet, post or share, the more people that can join and help us bring WordPress to a correct GDPR level.
