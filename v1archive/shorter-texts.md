##Shorter texts

From the [4 April compliance chat recap](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/05/gdpr-compliance-chat-recap-april-4/):
*"Some shorter/other texts will be needed to add to core, but can then have links to the final privacy blog: WP default policy, text for new user registration and on user profile screen, technical text about the new functions for developer.wordpress.org , chapter in the plugin handbook"*

### External links
- WP default policy (presumably meaning [https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/)
- Technical text about the new functions for developer.wordpress.org
- Chapter in the plugin handbook (Collaborative effort in progress)

### Tooltips/UX
- Text for new user registration and on-user profile screen
