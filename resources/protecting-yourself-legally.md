- If legally required, are you registered as a data controller with your [national data protection authority](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-are-data-protection-authorities-dpas_en)?
- If legally required, are you registered in international data protection programs such as [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome)?
- If legally required, have you signed a data processing agreement with your third parties or subprocessors?
- If you capture user data in a service or product, have you determined whether you are legally required to create and document a [Privacy Impact Assessment](https://github.com/wordpress-privacy/info/blob/master/resources/privacy-impact-assessment.md)?
- If you are legally required to create and document a PIA, have you considered [these questions](https://github.com/wordpress-privacy/info/blob/master/resources/privacy-impact-assessment.md)?
