#What is personal data?

European privacy law defines _personal data_ as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly — in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to their physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity."

The European concept of _personal data_ is very different to, and distinct from, the U.S. concept of _personally identifiable information_ (PII), which is defined as "any information about an individual, including any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records; and any other information that is linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."

The two are legal terms which should not be used indistinguishably; for example, a privacy notice targeting European customers should not use the term "PII".
