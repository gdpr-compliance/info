# What is personal data?

The European data protection framework pertains to _personal data_. This is defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” This can be one piece of information or multiple data points combined to create a record.
 
Beyond personal data there is also _sensitive personal data_, defined as information about a person’s
 
* Racial or ethnic origin
* Political opinions
* Religious or philosophical beliefs
* Trade union membership
* Health data
* Sex life or sexual orientation
* Past or spent criminal convictions
 
Sensitive personal data requires stricter protections than regular personal data, and the consequences for its leakage or misuse are greater.

GDPR expands the definition of personal data to include
 
* Genetic data
* Biometric data (such as facial recognition or fingerprint logins)
* Location data
* Pseudonymised data
* Online identifiers
 
The latter definition is important for developers. It includes things like IP addresses, mobile device IDs, browser fingerprints, RFID tags, MAC addresses, cookies, telemetry, user account IDs, and any other form of data which is identifiable to a natural person.

## Who uses personal data?
Personal data is used by _data controllers_ and _data processors_. The data controller is a person or an entity, such as you or your organisation, which decides what data is collected, how it is used, and whom it is shared with. The data processor is any entity other than the data controller who processes the data on their behalf. 

As a developer, you may be a data controller, you may be a data processor, and you may be both.

## Personally Identifiable Information
The European concept of _personal data_ is very different to, and distinct from, the U.S. concept of _personally identifiable information_ (PII), which is defined as "any information about an individual, including any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records; and any other information that is linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."

_Personal data_ and _personally identifiable information_ are legal definitions which should not be used indistinguishably; for example, a privacy notice targeting European customers should not use the term "PII".
